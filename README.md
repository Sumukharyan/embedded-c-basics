# Embedded C Basics

This repository contains beginner-level Embedded C programs written in a
hardware-independent way.

## Day 1

- Set up Git and GitHub
- Created first Embedded C project
- Uploaded professional repository structure

## Tools Used

- C Language
- Git & GitHub

## Future Scope

- RTOS integration
- MQTT-based communication
- Hardware porting (STM32 / ESP32)

## Day 2

- Implemented multi-file Embedded C project structure
- Used header files for hardware abstraction
- Designed LED module scalable to real GPIO hardware

## Day 3

- Implemented finite state machine (FSM) in Embedded C
- Designed LED control logic using states and transitions
- Structured application logic similar to RTOS task loops

## Day 4
- Implemented non-blocking software timer logic in Embedded C
- Replaced blocking delays with time-based state transitions
- Designed FSM suitable for RTOS task execution
